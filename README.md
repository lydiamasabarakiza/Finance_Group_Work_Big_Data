# **Stock Performance Analysis and Prediction**

## **Introduction**

In this project, we delve into the intricate influences on stock performance, analyzing the impacts of significant global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, and presidential elections. Our objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between these factors, market sentiment, and stock price fluctuations.

We explore the stock performance of selected companies across quarters, examining trends and changes in key metrics such as low, high, open, and close prices. Additionally, we provide insights into specific company performance, identifying factors that influenced their stock prices during the observed periods.

## **Key Findings**

### Overall Volume Analysis

- **Apple**:
Ongoing legal battles, including antitrust lawsuits and class-action cases, have raised concerns about the company's future business operations and financial obligations.
Reduced trading volume reflects investor caution amidst uncertainties surrounding Apple's legal standing.

- **Google**:
Decreased trading volume attributed to increased regulatory scrutiny, concerns over privacy and data handling practices, and saturation in its core advertising market.
Market saturation and slower growth rates in certain business areas contribute to the decline in trading activity.

- **BlackRock**:
Consistently low trading volume due to a predominantly institutional investor base with longer investment horizons and reduced trading frequency.
Emphasis on long-term investment strategies, stringent regulatory compliance, and risk management practices contribute to sustained ownership and minimal trading activity.

- **Samsung**:
Trading volume influenced by factors such as ownership structure, market dynamics, industry focus, corporate governance, and broader economic and geopolitical factors in South Korea.

- **Lockheed Martin**:
Increased stock price following geopolitical events due to heightened demand for defense products and services amid uncertainty.
Perception of defense stocks as safer investments during uncertain periods contributes to higher stock prices.

### **Second Quarter Trends**:
Across multiple years, a decline in stock prices was observed, attributed to factors such as quarterly earnings reports falling short of expectations, worsening economic indicators, and seasonal trends.

### **Transition to Third Quarter**:
Most stocks experienced a steady rise, with notable growth seen in Meta and Amazon. However, BlackRock and Boeing demonstrated comparatively modest improvements during this period.

### **Factors Affecting Specific Companies**:

- **Boeing**: Prolonged grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft and reduced air travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Meta** (formerly Facebook): Regulatory scrutiny, public backlash over data privacy issues, and increased competition in the social media space.

- **Amazon**: Rising operational costs, regulatory scrutiny, and competition in the e-commerce sector.

- **Google**: Regulatory challenges, changes in advertising spending patterns, and competition in online advertising.

### **Election Period Analysis**:

- Days leading to elections witnessed a slight decline in trading activity, attributed to investor caution.
- Increased trading activity followed elections, driven by clarity provided by election results and adjustments to portfolios based on the new political landscape.

### **COVID-19 Impact**:
- Unprecedented disruptions across sectors, analyzed through stock price movements of selected companies.

- Increased demand for defense stocks amid geopolitical tensions, reflected in Lockheed Martin's stock price increase.
